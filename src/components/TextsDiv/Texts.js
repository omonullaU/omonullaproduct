                        <p>
                            At ShoeZero, we use an innovative process to print vibrant designs on <br /> the custom shoes. However, it is still an involved process, so it takes 10 business days to: set the physical shoe parts up to match software, print on all the parts, dry the parts, sew the parts together, form the shoe, seal the shoe to preserve the design, heat treat again, and then finally ship off.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            We  3 forms of shipping: Slow, Standard, and Expedited. We <br /> recommend at least doing standard shipping because slow shipping is <br /> very inconsistent. Standard shipping takes 10-15 business days and <br /> expedited takes 7-10 days. NOTE: Shipping times are after production <br /> times (see above). Producing these custom shoes is very complex <br /> (See above) so please also remember that production will take around <br /> 10 business days

                        <p>
                            Requires a computer running an operating system. The computer must have some
                            memory and ideally some kind of long-term storage. An input device as well
                            as some form of output device is recommended.

                            Yes! You can resell our shoes in a variety of ways. The main way our <br /> partners sell their custom shoes is right on our marketplace featured <br /> on our site. The most successful custom shoe designers drive traffic  <br /> their shoe design. Other designers sell their shoes via social media, <br /> ads, or even in physical stores. Once your shoe is listed on our <br /> marketplace, let your creativity run as far as all the avenues to get the <br /> shoes out to your fans. We highly recommend trying to partner with <br /> influencers to help them launch shoes too because that has been the <br /> most successful.
